# Speech Text Reader

This project is used to communicate with certain captions assigned to it i.e, some basic needs, some feelings and some places.

Also, it provides a custom textbox where you can provide whatever you want to listen. And you can change the voices too alongwith the different languages.

This projects uses [Web Speech API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Speech_API) which still is in experimental technology but mostly for speech recognition.
